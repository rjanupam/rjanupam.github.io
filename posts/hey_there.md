## Hey there!

### Anupam here!

So, is this a blog, nah..
I will just post something every now and then (sounds like a blog huh). Who's gonna read it all anyway, well actually I only know just 4 people who will every now and then come looking for new posts. Prolly I will make new friends.

I created the site only cuz I wanted to, though I also want to have a domain name and host it on my own server. There time guys; maybe someday when I earn a living.

I will post stuff that I do, and my interests. Honestly, I have no idea what this will turn into.

For today, I am gonna leave a tip here:

> *Procrastination is opportunity's assassin.*

So get up anon, what are you waiting for.
